# About QSR

**QSR** (Quick Stats Reporter) is an extremely useful R/Shiny web application for quick data analysis and reporting. It determines on its own what kind of table and graph to generate depending on the type of variable(s) selected. It generates tabular reports in `.csv`, `.pdf`, & `.htlm`, and graphical reports in `.png`, `.pdf`, & `.svg` formats. 

This minimalist application is designed to handle univariate, bivariate, and trivariate analyses. See instructions under <u>Stats</u> tab for more information about these analyses.
